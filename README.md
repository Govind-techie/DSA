# DSA Journey Repository üöÄ

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey! This repository contains all my notes, code, and progress throughout my DSA exploration. I aim to regularly update this repository as I learn new concepts, solve problems, and enhance my understanding.

## üìö Topics Covered

### **Arrays** 
- **Basics of Arrays**: Understanding array declaration, initialization, and memory layout.  
- **Loops Over Arrays**: Iterating through arrays using different loop constructs.  
- **Pass by Reference**: Understanding how arrays are passed to functions and their behavior.  
- **Linear Search Algorithm**: Implementing and analyzing the linear search algorithm.  
- **Reverse Array**: Reversing an array using the Two-Pointer Approach.  
- **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Implementing a function to find common elements between two arrays.  

### **Vectors**
- **Basics of Vectors**: Understanding vector declaration, initialization, and dynamic resizing.  
- **Vector Functions**: Exploring common vector functions like `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`, `at()`, etc., and their usage.  
- **For-Each Loop**: Using the range-based `for` each loop to iterate over vectors and access their elements directly.

## üìù Completed Homework Problems
- **Problem 1**: Write a function to sum and product all the numbers of an array.  
- **Problem 2**: Write a function to swap max and min values of an array.  
- **Problem 3**: Write a function to print all unique values of an array.  
- **Problem 4**: Write a function to print intersection (common values) of 2 arrays.
