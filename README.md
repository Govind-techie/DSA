# DSA Journey Repository 🚀

This repository contains my entire codebase and notes from my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey. I will update it regularly to reflect my progress, new concepts learned, and improvements in understanding.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Arrays** 
  - Basics of Arrays: Understanding array declaration, initialization, and memory layout.  
  - Loops Over Arrays: Iterating through arrays using different loop constructs.  
  - Pass by Reference: Understanding how arrays are passed to functions and their behavior.  
  - Linear Search Algorithm: Implementing and analyzing the linear search algorithm.  
  - Reverse Array: Reversing an array using the Two-Pointer Approach.  
  - Intersection of Two Arrays: Implementing a function to find common elements between two arrays.  

## 📝 Completed Homework Problems
- Problem 1: Write a function to sum and product all the numbers of an array.  
- Problem 2: Write a function to swap max and min values of an array.  
- Problem 3: Write a function to print all unique values of an array.  
- Problem 4: Write a function to print intersection (common values) of 2 arrays.
