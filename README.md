# DSA Journey Repository üöÄ

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey! This repository contains all my notes, code, and progress throughout my DSA exploration. I aim to regularly update this repository as I learn new concepts, solve problems, and enhance my understanding.

## üìö Topics Covered

### **Arrays** 
- **Basics of Arrays**: Understanding array declaration, initialization, and memory layout.  
- **Loops Over Arrays**: Iterating through arrays using different loop constructs.  
- **Pass by Reference**: Understanding how arrays are passed to functions and their behavior.  
- **Linear Search Algorithm**: Implementing and analyzing the linear search algorithm.  
- **Reverse Array**: Reversing an array using the Two-Pointer Approach.  
- **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Implementing a function to find common elements between two arrays.  

### **Vectors**
- **Basics of Vectors**: Understanding vector declaration, initialization, and dynamic resizing.  
- **Vector Functions**: Exploring common vector functions like `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`, `at()`, etc., and their usage.  
- **For-Each Loop**: Using the range-based `for` each loop to iterate over vectors and access their elements directly.
- **Static Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated at compile-time for fixed-size arrays.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated at runtime for structures like vectors, with dynamic resizing.

### **Kadane's Algorithm**
- **Kadane's Algorithm**:  
  Kadane's algorithm is an efficient method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of numbers. It operates in **O(n)** time, making it significantly faster than the brute-force approach. 

### **Moore's Voting Algorithm**
- **Moore's Voting Algorithm**:  
  This algorithm helps find the majority element (the element that appears more than **n / 2** times) in an array. It maintains a candidate and a counter. If the counter reaches zero, a new candidate is chosen. The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time with constant space.

## ‚è≥ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: I have learned that time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases with respect to the input size. It helps to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms, especially for large inputs.  
- **Space Complexity**: Space complexity evaluates the amount of memory required by an algorithm as the input size grows. It helps to understand the memory efficiency of an algorithm.  
- **Big O Notation**: I have also learned about Big O notation, which is used to describe the worst-case scenario for time or space complexity, providing a way to compare algorithms based on how they scale with increasing input size.


## üéØ LeetCode Problems
- **Problem 136: Single Number** (Difficulty: Easy)  
   Solution for finding the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.

- **Problem 53: Maximum Subarray Sum** (Difficulty: Medium)  
   Solution for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using the brute-force approach.

- **Problem 1: Two Sum** (Difficulty: Easy)  
   Solution for finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target value.

- **Problem 169: Majority Element** (Difficulty: Easy)  
   Solution for finding the majority element in an array that appears more than **n / 2** times.
