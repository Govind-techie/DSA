# DSA Journey Repository 🚀

This repository contains my entire codebase and notes from my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey. I will update it regularly to reflect my progress, new concepts learned, and improvements in understanding.

📚 Topics Covered

1. Arrays
	•	Basics of Arrays: Understanding array declaration, initialization, and memory layout.
	•	Loops Over Arrays: Iterating through arrays using different loop constructs.
	•	Pass by Reference: Understanding how arrays are passed to functions and their behavior.
	•	Linear Search Algorithm: Implementing and analyzing the linear search algorithm.
	•	Reverse Array: Reversing an array using the Two-Pointer Approach.
	•	Intersection of Two Arrays: Implementing a function to find common elements between two arrays.

📝 Completed Homework Problems
	•	Problem 1: Write a function to sum and product all the numbers of array.
	•	Problem 2: Write a function to swap max and min values of array.
	•	Problem 3: Write a function to print all unique values of array.
	•	Problem 4: Write a function to print intersection (common values) of 2 arrays.
