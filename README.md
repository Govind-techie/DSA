# **DSA Journey Repository ðŸš€**

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey! This repository contains all my notes, code, and progress throughout my DSA exploration. I aim to regularly update this repository as I learn new concepts, solve problems, and enhance my understanding.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### **Arrays**
- **Basics of Arrays**: Understanding array declaration, initialization, and memory layout.
- **Loops Over Arrays**: Iterating through arrays using different loop constructs.
- **Pass by Reference**: Understanding how arrays are passed to functions and their behavior.
- **Linear Search Algorithm**: Implementing and analyzing the linear search algorithm.
- **Reverse Array**: Reversing an array using the Two-Pointer Approach.
- **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Implementing a function to find common elements between two arrays.

### **2D Arrays**
- **Basics of 2D Arrays**: Understanding declaration, initialization, and accessing elements using row and column indices.
- **Row-wise and Column-wise Traversal**: Iterating through 2D arrays by rows and columns.
- **Linear Search in 2D Arrays**: Searching for an element by traversing a 2D matrix.
- **Important Problems**: Solving problems like Spiral Matrix Traversal, Matrix Transposition, and Searching in a Sorted Matrix.

### **Vectors**
- **Basics of Vectors**: Understanding vector declaration, initialization, and dynamic resizing.
- **Vector Functions**: Exploring common vector functions like `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`, `at()`, etc., and their usage.
- **For-Each Loop**: Using the range-based `for` each loop to iterate over vectors and access their elements directly.
- **Static Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated at compile-time for fixed-size arrays.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated at runtime for structures like vectors, with dynamic resizing.

### **Strings and Character Arrays**
- **Basics of Strings**: Understanding C++ `string` class, declaration, and initialization.
- **Important String Functions**: Using functions like `length()`, `find()`, `substr()`, `append()`, `erase()`, etc.
- **Character Arrays**: Working with traditional character arrays (`char arr[]`) and manual operations like input, output, and string termination with `\0`.
- **String Problems Solved**:
  - **Valid Palindrome**
  - **Valid Anagram**

### **Kadane's Algorithm**
- **Kadane's Algorithm**:  
  Kadane's algorithm is an efficient method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of numbers. It operates in **O(n)** time, making it significantly faster than the brute-force approach.

### **Moore's Voting Algorithm**
- **Moore's Voting Algorithm**:  
  This algorithm helps find the majority element (the element that appears more than **n / 2** times) in an array. It maintains a candidate and a counter. If the counter reaches zero, a new candidate is chosen. The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time with constant space.

### **Time and Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: Understanding how algorithms scale with input size.
- **Space Complexity**: Evaluating the memory usage of algorithms.
- **Big O Notation**: Used to describe the worst-case performance of an algorithm.

### **Binary Exponentiation**
- **Binary Exponentiation**:  
  An efficient method to calculate **x^n** in **O(log n)** time using exponentiation by squaring.

### **Pointers**
- **Basics of Pointers**: Memory addresses, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.
- **Pointer to Pointer**: Storing addresses of pointers.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `new` and `delete`.
- **Pointer and Arrays**: Understanding arrays as pointers and using pointer arithmetic.

### **Bit Manipulation**
- **Introduction to Bits**: Understanding binary representation and bit-level operations.
- **Bitwise Operators**: Using `AND (&)`, `OR (|)`, `XOR (^)`, `NOT (~)`, `Left Shift (<<)`, and `Right Shift (>>)` operators.
- **Common Bit Tricks**: Checking even/odd, swapping numbers, counting set bits, turning bits on/off.
- **Applications**: Solving problems like finding the unique number, checking power of two, and more.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Basic Concepts**: Understanding classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Lifecycle of an object and memory management.
- **Types of Inheritance**: Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical, and Hybrid inheritance with examples.
- **Real-World Examples**: Applying OOP concepts to practical C++ programs and system design.

### **Binary Search Algorithm**
- **Iterative Approach**: Uses a loop to repeatedly divide the array in half.
- **Recursive Approach**: Uses function calls to divide the array recursively.
- **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)** in a sorted array.

## **Standard Template Library (STL) ðŸš€**
The **Standard Template Library (STL)** provides a collection of built-in **data structures** and **algorithms** in C++. It simplifies coding by offering optimized implementations of commonly used functionalities.

- **Pair**: A container that holds two values of possibly different types.
- **Vector**: A **dynamic array** that can grow or shrink automatically.
- **List**: A **doubly linked list** allowing efficient insertion and deletion.
- **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Allows insertion and deletion from both the **front** and **back** in constant time.
