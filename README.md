### **Kadane's Algorithm**
- **Kadane's Algorithm**:  
  Kadane's algorithm is an efficient method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of numbers. It operates in **O(n)** time, making it significantly faster than the brute-force approach.

### **Moore's Voting Algorithm**
- **Moore's Voting Algorithm**:  
  This algorithm helps find the majority element (the element that appears more than **n / 2** times) in an array. It maintains a candidate and a counter. If the counter reaches zero, a new candidate is chosen. The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time with constant space.

### **Time and Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: Understanding how algorithms scale with input size.
- **Space Complexity**: Evaluating the memory usage of algorithms.
- **Big O Notation**: Used to describe the worst-case performance of an algorithm.

### **Binary Exponentiation**
- **Binary Exponentiation**:  
  An efficient method to calculate **x^n** in **O(log n)** time using exponentiation by squaring.

### **Pointers**
- **Basics of Pointers**: Memory addresses, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.
- **Pointer to Pointer**: Storing addresses of pointers.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `new` and `delete`.
- **Pointer and Arrays**: Understanding arrays as pointers and using pointer arithmetic.

### **Bit Manipulation**
- **Introduction to Bits**: Understanding binary representation and bit-level operations.
- **Bitwise Operators**: Using `AND (&)`, `OR (|)`, `XOR (^)`, `NOT (~)`, `Left Shift (<<)`, and `Right Shift (>>)` operators.
- **Common Bit Tricks**: Checking even/odd, swapping numbers, counting set bits, turning bits on/off.
- **Applications**: Solving problems like finding the unique number, checking power of two, and more.

### **Recursion**
- **What is Recursion?**: A function that calls itself to solve smaller subproblems of a larger problem. Useful for tasks that can be broken down into similar subtasks.
- **Base Case and Recursive Case**: Every recursive function must have a base case to stop the recursion and a recursive case that breaks the problem down.
- **Types of Recursion**:
  - **Tail Recursion**: The recursive call is the last operation in the function.
  - **Head Recursion**: The recursive call is made before any other processing.
  - **Tree Recursion**: A function makes multiple recursive calls.
  - **Indirect Recursion**: A function calls another function which eventually calls the original function.
- **Call Stack Behavior**: Each recursive call is pushed to the stack and popped when it completes. Understanding the call stack is key to avoiding stack overflow.
- **Use Cases**: Recursion is ideal for problems like factorial, Fibonacci numbers, tree traversals, and divide-and-conquer algorithms like merge sort.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Basic Concepts**: Understanding classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Lifecycle of an object and memory management.
- **Types of Inheritance**: Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical, and Hybrid inheritance with examples.
- **Real-World Examples**: Applying OOP concepts to practical C++ programs and system design.

### **Binary Search Algorithm**
- **Iterative Approach**: Uses a loop to repeatedly divide the array in half.
- **Recursive Approach**: Uses function calls to divide the array recursively.
- **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)** in a sorted array.

### **Divide and Conquer**
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the results. Time complexity: **O(n log n)**.
- **Quick Sort**: Picks a pivot, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the partitions. Average case: **O(n log n)**, Worst case: **O(nÂ²)**.
- **Rotated Sorted Array Search**: Modified binary search to find an element in a rotated sorted array. Time complexity: **O(log n)**.

### **Standard Template Library (STL) ðŸš€**
The **Standard Template Library (STL)** provides a collection of built-in **data structures** and **algorithms** in C++. It simplifies coding by offering optimized implementations of commonly used functionalities.

- **Pair**: A container that holds two values of possibly different types.
- **Vector**: A **dynamic array** that can grow or shrink automatically.
- **List**: A **doubly linked list** allowing efficient insertion and deletion.
- **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Allows insertion and deletion from both the **front** and **back** in constant time.

### **Linked Lists**
- **Basics of Linked List**: Understanding nodes, pointers, and how linked lists differ from arrays in memory allocation.
- **Class Implementation of Singly Linked List**: Defining a `Node` class and managing the list through insertion, traversal, and deletion.
- **Insert at End**: Adding new elements at the end of the list using pointer manipulation.
- **Print the List**: Traversing the list and printing all node values sequentially.
- **Search in Linked List**: Recursively or iteratively checking if a value exists in the list.
- **Reverse Linked List**: Reversing the entire list by updating the `next` pointers using an iterative method.
- **Remove Nth Node from End**: Removing the nth node from the end using two-pointer (fast and slow) technique.
- **Check Palindrome**: Checking if the linked list is a palindrome by reversing the second half and comparing both halves.

### **Stacks**
- **Introduction to Stack**: A **Last In First Out (LIFO)** data structure where the last element added is the first to be removed.
- **Stack Operations**:
  - `push()`: Add an element to the top.
  - `pop()`: Remove the top element.
  - `top()` / `peek()`: View the top element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Using Arrays**: Implementing a static stack using fixed-size arrays.
  - **Using Vectors**: Dynamic stack implementation using C++ vectors.
