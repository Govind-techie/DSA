# DSA Journey Repository ðŸš€

This repository contains my entire codebase and notes from my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey. I will update it regularly to reflect my progress, new concepts learned, and improvements in understanding.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### 1. Arrays
- **Basics of Arrays**: Understanding array declaration, initialization, and memory layout.  
- **Loops Over Arrays**: Iterating through arrays using different loop constructs.  
- **Pass by Reference**: Understanding how arrays are passed to functions and their behavior.  
- **Linear Search Algorithm**: Implementing and analyzing the linear search algorithm.  
- **Reverse Array**: Reversing an array using the Two-Pointer Approach.
