### **Binary Search Tree**
- **Introduction**: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a value such that the left child is less than the node and the right child is greater.
- **Properties**:
  - Left subtree contains nodes with values less than the root.
  - Right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the root.
  - Inorder traversal of BST gives a sorted sequence.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Recursively insert elements maintaining BST property.

  - **Traversal**: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder.

- **Applications**:
  - Efficient searching and insertion.
  - Used in databases and range queries.
  - Basis for self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black Trees.

### **Heaps / Priority Queue**

- **Introduction to Heaps**:  
  A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:  
  - **Max-Heap**: The key at the root must be maximum among all keys present in the heap.  
  - **Min-Heap**: The key at the root must be minimum among all keys present in the heap.  
  Heaps are commonly implemented as binary trees but are usually stored as arrays for efficient indexing.

- **Heap Properties**:  
  - Complete binary tree (all levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right).  
  - Parent node is either greater than (max-heap) or less than (min-heap) its children.

- **Operations on Heaps**:
  - **Insertion**: Add the new element at the end of the heap and heapify up to maintain the heap property.  
  - **Deletion** (typically the root): Replace root with the last element, remove the last element, then heapify down.  
  - **Peek**: Access the root element (max or min) in constant time **O(1)**.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insertion: **O(log n)**  
  - Deletion (Extract Max/Min): **O(log n)**  
  - Peek (Get Max/Min): **O(1)**

- **Priority Queue**:  
  A data structure built on top of heaps that allows elements to be processed based on priority rather than insertion order.  
  - By default, C++ STL `priority_queue` is a max-heap.  
  - Can be customized to behave as a min-heap by using a comparator.

- **Common Use Cases**:
  - **Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm** (using min-priority queue).  
  - **Huffman coding** (building the tree using min-heap).  
  - **Order statistics**: finding kth largest/smallest element.  
  - **Event-driven simulation**: managing events by priority.  
  - Efficiently implementing sorting algorithms like **Heap Sort**.

- **Heap Sort**:  
  A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It involves building a max-heap and repeatedly extracting the maximum element to get a sorted array. Time complexity: **O(n log n)**.
