/*
ACCESS SPECIFIERS IN C++ (Access Modifiers)

Access specifiers define the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables and functions).
They control how data and methods can be accessed both within the class and outside of it.

1. private:
   - Members are accessible only within the class itself.
   - Default access level for class members.
   - Used to implement encapsulation and data hiding.

2. public:
   - Members are accessible from outside the class using objects.
   - Exposes data or functionality to users of the class.

3. protected:
   - Members are accessible within the class and its derived (child) classes.
   - Not accessible from outside the class directly, but inherited by subclasses.

Syntax:
    class ClassName {
    private:
        // Private members
    public:
        // Public members
    protected:
        // Protected members
    };

Example:
    class Example {
    private:
        int secret;  // Private member

    public:
        void setSecret(int s) { secret = s; }  // Public method to access private member
        int getSecret() { return secret; }  // Public method to access private member
    };

Key Notes:
- Prefer keeping data members private and using public getter/setter methods to access them.
- This practice helps maintain the integrity of the object state and data encapsulation.

    // Real-life example: Things like passwords or functions like withdrawMoney() are kept private
    // to prevent unwanted access and protect sensitive data.

    // PUBLIC
