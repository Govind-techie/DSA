Problem: Trapping Rainwater

You are given an array `height[]` of size `n` representing the height of walls
where the width of each wall is 1 unit. After it rains, some water is trapped between the walls.

Your task is to calculate how much water can be trapped between the walls.


Input:
- `height`: An array of `n` non-negative integers.

Output:
- An integer representing the total units of trapped water.


Example:

Input:  height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Water is trapped between the bars â€” total 6 units.
